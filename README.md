# Data Visualisation

A collection of data visualisation examples built over *D3.js*.

Includes:
 - `top-twenty`: an easy way to give multiple "Top 20" lists from a collection of CSV files. Allows for changing the topic of the list and the number of elements of the list dynamically. Includes rollover text for further info.
